    "encounter and our suggestions for how to think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally find it useful when describing variable length sequence data\n",
    "to describe what it is a sequence of.  The basic types that we commonly\n",
    "encounter are: <font color='limegreen'>categorical</font> values, <font color='limegreen'>scalar</font> values and <font color='limegreen'>vector</font> values. Certainly scalar data could be thought of a simple one dimensional vector data but given the different techniques that can, and often are, applied to such data we feel that treating it as a seperate data type is warranted.\n",

    "For the most part our `vectorizers` take in a sequence of variable length sequences and learn a fixed width representation of these sequences.  Another way of thinking of this is transforming a jagged array of vectors into a fixed width array of vectors.  Fixed width representations are significantly more conducive to traditional machine leraning algorithms.\n",

    "WassersteinVectorizer should be considered the gold standard for vectorizing point clouds of data.  It makes use linear optimal transport to linearize and thus provide a reasonably scalable vectorization of a point cloud so that Euclidean or Cosine distance on this space will be a reasonable approximation of Wasserstein distance between the point cloud distrubitons.  SinkhornVectorizer can handle much larger distributions of data and is generally more efficient but this efficiency may come with some loss of quality.  Lastly, we include an ApproximateWassersteinVectorizer which is a heuristic linear algebra based solution which poorly approximates our WassersteinVectorizer but is very, very fast.  "
